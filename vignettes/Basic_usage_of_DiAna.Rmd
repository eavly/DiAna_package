# DiAna: Disproportionality Analysis for Pharmacovigilance

## Introduction

Welcome to DiAna, your go-to R package for performing disproportionality
analysis on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). DiAna
simplifies the process of importing cleaned FAERS data, retrieving cases
of interest, conducting descriptive analysis, and performing
disproportionality analysis. Whether you're a novice or an expert in
pharmacovigilance, DiAna is designed to make your analyses easy and
efficient.

## Prerequisites: Installing R and R Studio

Before you can start using DiAna, you need to have R and R Studio
installed on your system. If you haven't installed them yet, follow
these simple steps:

1.  Installing R Visit the official R project website
    (<https://cran.r-project.org>) and download the appropriate version
    of R for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Run the
    installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation.
    R provides a powerful and flexible environment for statistical
    computing and graphics, forming the foundation for your data
    analysis with DiAna.

2.  Installing R Studio R Studio is an integrated development
    environment (IDE) for R that makes your R programming easier and
    more efficient. Once R is installed, go to the R Studio website
    (<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>) and download the free
    version of R Studio Desktop. Install R Studio by following the
    installation instructions for your operating system.

With R and R Studio installed, you have a comprehensive and
user-friendly environment ready for conducting pharmacovigilance
analyses using DiAna.

## Setting Up Your DiAna Project

For an organized and efficient workflow, we recommend creating a
dedicated project for your DiAna analyses. Follow these steps to set up
your DiAna project in R Studio:

1.  Open R Studio: Start by opening R Studio on your computer. If you've
    just installed R Studio, you can find it in your applications or
    programs menu.

2.  Create a New Project: In R Studio, click on File in the upper left
    corner, then select New Project. Choose New Directory and then New
    Project. Name your project (e.g., "DiAna") and specify a location on
    your Desktop or any preferred directory.

3.  Install the DiAna package: Begin by installing the DiAna package
    from [GitHub](https://github.com/) writing and running the following
    lines in the console:

```{r install_DiAna, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fusarolimichele/DiAna_package")
```

It may be useful to run this command from time to time to download the
latest update to the package (e.g., bugs solved, new or improved
functions)

4.  Setup the DiAna project: The first time we use DiAna, we have to set
    up the folder where the data will be stored together with the
    results of the analyses. This command will require a good internet
    connection. The better your internet connection, the faster the
    download. It usually takes between a few minutes and 20 minutes. On
    the console, we run the two rows below (note that rows preceded by a
    \# are comments and not commands):

```{r setup_DiAna, eval=FALSE}
library(DiAna)
setup_DiAna(quarter = "23Q1")
# input yes when asked to download the FAERS
```

With library DiAna we have imported the DiAna package (i.e., the toolbox
with all the functions that we will use in our analyses). With
setup_DiAna(quarter="23Q1") we are automaticatilly setting up the
project: it will create a folder to store cleaned FAERS data, that will
be downloaded from an OSF repository (in particular we are downloading
the FAERS updated to the 23Q1 quarter). The entire cleaning process is
made transparent on the github
(<https://github.com/fusarolimichele/DiAna>). It will also create a
folder for external sources and a folder to store projects. In the
external sources, it will also download the DiAna dictionary used to
translate free text drug names into active ingredients, a linkage to the
ATC code, and other useful data sources.

As you can see some external sources are not available for download
because they require subscription (e.g., MedDRA).

## Getting Started

Now that you have R and R Studio installed, you have installed the DiAna
package, and you have set up your project, you are all set to begin your
journey with DiAna.

### Starting a subproject

With DiAna the main project, we now want to create a subproject specific
for this tutorial. The first thing we do is open a new R script (the
white paper with the green and white cross on the top left corner of
rstudio) and insert some details on the project. As specified before,
every time we use a \# we are inserting a comment. Comments are
extremely useful to document and explain our project, but are not run
and do not affect the results.

```{r project_details}
# Information -----------------------------------------------------------------

## Version --------------------------------------------------------------------
### Set up: 2023-10-08### Last update: 2023-10-08
```

### **Setting Up Your DiAna Subproject**

In this section, we guide you through setting up a subproject within
your DiAna analysis environment. The following R code snippet creates a
new directory named "tutorial" within the "projects" folder of your
DiAna package. It specifies the version of the FAERS dataset to be used
(in this case, "23Q1"). The **`here::here()`** function helps locate the
current DiAna package directory, and the project_path variable is
defined to point to the "tutorial" folder within your DiAna package.

```{r setup_subproject}
# Set up ----------------------------------------------------------------------
dir.create(paste0(here::here(), "/projects/tutorial"), recursive = TRUE)
FAERS_version <- "23Q1"
DiAna_path <- here::here()
project_path <- paste0(DiAna_path, "/projects/tutorial/")
```

By running this code, you establish a structured subproject environment.
The "tutorial" folder will contain the necessary files and
configurations for your subproject, ensuring a seamless and organized
analysis experience.

Finally, we save the script in the subproject folder, using the blue
floppy icon above the script.

### **Input data and packages**

In the DiAna package, seamless data import is a crucial aspect of
empowering pharmacovigilance analyses. The first code chunk utilizes the
import() function to load essential datasets from the FDA Adverse Event
Reporting System (FAERS). By importing datasets like "DRUG," "REAC,"
"DEMO," and "INDI," DiAna equips users with comprehensive information
about drugs, adverse reactions, patient demographics, and indications.In

"REAC," "DEMO," and "INDI," DiAna equips users with comprehensive
information about drugs, adverse reactions, patient demographics, and
indications.

```{r import_FAERS, message=FALSE,results='hide'}
## Packages -------------------------------------------------------------------
library(DiAna)

## Input FAERS ---------------------------------------------------------------
import("DRUG")
import("REAC")
import("DEMO")
import("INDI")

# Try also importing and look at the information included in DEMO_SUPP, OUTC, THER, DOSES, DRUG_SUPP, DRUG_NAME
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(tail(Demo), caption = "Example of demographics data")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(tail(Reac), caption = "Example of reaction data")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(tail(Drug), caption = "Example of drug data")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(tail(Indi), caption = "Example of indication data")
```

Moreover, DiAna offers functionality to import data related to the
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification linked to the
active ingredients as translated by the DiAna dictionary. This ATC file
is a crucial component for grouping drugs based on their therapeutic
use. Please note that we cannot provide the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), which is only upon subscription, and
therefore the import_MedDRA function will not work for you. If you have
access to MedDRA, you can follow the instructions on the GitHub
repository to create the MedDRA file for the import_MedDRA function.

```{r input_ATC,results='hide'}
import_ATC()
# we cannot make the meddra available because it is only upon subscription, but here we usually also use the import_MedDRA()) function for grouping events
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(tail(ATC), caption = "Example of ATC data")
```

### **Selecting analysis parameters**

In this code chunk, we define the specific parameters for our analysis
in DiAna. **`drugs_selected`** is set to "haloperidol," representing the
drug of interest, and **`events_selected`** is set to "pneumonia,"
indicating the adverse event under investigation. These parameters play
a pivotal role in guiding the disproportionality analysis. By specifying
the drug and adverse event of focus, users can narrow down their
analysis to a particular scenario, allowing for a more targeted and
insightful exploration of adverse event patterns related to the selected
drug. The flexibility to customize these and other parameters (e.g.,
population), as we will see in the following paragraphs, enhances the
precision of the analysis, enabling users to derive meaningful
conclusions about drug safety within the pharmacovigilance framework.

```{r parameters_selection}
drugs_selected <- "haloperidol"

events_selected <- "pneumonia"
```

### **Cases identification and retrieval**

In this code segment, we delve into the process of cases identification
and retrieval within the DiAna package. Firstly, reports associated with
the specified drug of interest, denoted as **`drugs_selected`**, are
identified using the Drug dataset. Similarly, adverse event reports
related to the chosen event (**`events_selected`**) are extracted from
the Reac dataset. The intersection of these two sets of primary IDs
(**`pids_drugs`** and **`pids_events`**) identifies cases where both the
drug and the adverse event are reported. These cases are crucial for
in-depth individual assessment and analysis.

```{r cases_identification}
# we identify the reports with the drug
pids_drugs <- unique(Drug[substance %in% drugs_selected]$primaryid)

# we identify the reports with the event
pids_events <- unique(Reac[pt %in% events_selected]$primaryid)

# we identify cases as reports with both the drug and the event
pids_cases <- intersect(pids_drugs, pids_events)
```

To facilitate further scrutiny and analysis, DiAna offers the
**`retrieve()`** function, which gathers the information about these
identified cases from the different FAERS dataset and stores it into two
Excel files: one with a row for each case, one with multiple rows for
each case recording more detailed drug information. The **`file_name`**
parameter, specified as **`paste0(project_path, "individual_cases")`**,
ensures that the retrieved cases are stored within the designated
subproject folder.

```{r cases_retrieval, eval=FALSE}
# retrieve the cases into an excel for individual assessment
retrieve(pids_cases, file_name = paste0(project_path, "individual_cases"))
```

This step is pivotal, allowing pharmacovigilance experts to conduct
detailed examinations of individual cases, thereby enhancing the
precision and depth of the analysis. DiAna's seamless case retrieval
mechanism simplifies the process, empowering users to focus on in-depth
assessments of specific adverse event patterns associated with the
chosen drug.
