)
}
\arguments{
\item{pids_cases}{Vector of primary IDs to consider for counting reactions.}

\item{entity}{Entity investigated. It can be one of the following:

\item \emph{reaction};
\item \emph{indication};
\item \emph{substance}.
}}

\item{level}{The desired MedDRA or ATC level for counting (default is "pt").}

\item{quarter}{set on FAERS_version, which can be provided at the beginning of the script.}
}
\value{
A data.table containing counts and percentages of the investigated entity
at the specified level and in descending order.
}
\description{
counts the occurrences of reactions/indications/substance

Calculates \% as the proportion of individuals recording the event.
