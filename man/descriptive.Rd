\arguments{
\item{pids_cases}{A vector of primary IDs for cases.}

\item{RG}{A vector of primary IDs: reference group. Default is NULL.}

\item{drug}{A vector of drug names. Default is NULL.}

\item{save_in_excel}{Whether to save the outcome in an excel. Defaults to TRUE}

\item{file_name}{The name of the Excel file to save the results. Default is "Descriptives.xlsx". It only works if save_in_excel is TRUE.}

\item{vars}{A character vector of variable names to include in the analysis.}

\item{list_pids}{A list of vectors with primary IDs for custom groups whose distribution should be described. Default is an empty list.}

\item{method}{The method for Chi-square test analysis, either "independence_test" or "goodness_of_fit". Default is "independence_test". It applies only for comparisons between cases and non-cases.}

\item{temp_demo}{Demo dataset. Defaults to Demo. Can be se to sample_Demo for testing}

\item{temp_drug}{Drug dataset. Can be set to sample_Drug for testing}

\item{temp_reac}{Reac dataset. Can be set to sample_Reac for testing}

\item{temp_indi}{Indi dataset. Can be set to sample_Indi for testing}

\item{temp_outc}{Outc dataset. Can be set to sample_Outc for testing}

\item{temp_ther}{Ther dataset. Can be set to sample_Ther for testing}
}
\value{
The function generates descriptive statistics as a gt_table and potentially saves them to an Excel file.
}
\description{
This function generates descriptive statistics for a sample of data, including cases and non-cases, and saves the results to an Excel file.
