\title{Perform time-to-onset analysis for drug-event associations}
\usage{
time_to_onset_analysis(
  drug_selected,
  reac_selected,
  temp_drug = Drug,
  temp_reac = Reac,
  temp_ther = Ther,
  meddra_level = "pt",
  drug_level = "substance",
  restriction = "none",
  minimum_cases = 3,
  max_TTO = 365,
  test = "AD"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{drug_selected}{A list of drugs for analysis. Can be a list of lists (to collapse terms together) if drug_level is set to custom.}

\item{reac_selected}{A list of adverse events for analysis. Can be a list of lists (to collapse terms together) if meddra_level is set to custom.}

\item{temp_drug}{Data table containing drug data (default is Drug). If set to Drug[role_cod \%in\% c("PS","SS")] allows to investigate only suspects.}

\item{temp_reac}{Data table containing reaction data (default is Reac).}

\item{temp_ther}{Data table containing therapy and temporal data (default is Ther).}

\item{meddra_level}{The desired MedDRA level for analysis (default is "pt"). If set to "custom" allows a list of lists for reac_selected (collapsing multiple terms).}

\item{drug_level}{The desired drug level for analysis (default is "substance"). If set to "custom" allows a list of lists for reac_selected (collapsing multiple terms).}

\item{restriction}{Primary IDs to consider for analysis (default is "none", which includes the entire population). If set to Demo[!RB_duplicates_only_susp]$primaryid, for example, allows to exclude duplicates according to one of the deduplication algorithms.}

\item{minimum_cases}{The minimum number of cases required for the analysis (default is 3).}

\item{max_TTO}{The maximum time to onset considered in the analysis, in days (default is 365).}

\item{test}{The two-sample goodness of fit test to apply for TTO analysis. Choices are AD (Anderson-Darling test - default) and KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).}
}
\value{
A data.table containing results of the time-to-onset analysis, including drug-event associations, KS test statistics, and p-values.
}
\description{
This function conducts a time-to-onset analysis for associations between drugs and events based on user-specified parameters.
}
\examples{
# This is just an example of how to use the function,
# as sample_Data has only little information about time to onset.
df <- time_to_onset_analysis(
  drug_selected = "skin care",
  reac_selected = list("skin affection" = list(

    "skin irritation",
    "erythema",
    "rash macular",
    "acne",
    "skin haemorrhage"
  )),
  temp_drug = sample_Drug, temp_reac = sample_Reac,
  temp_ther = sample_Ther
