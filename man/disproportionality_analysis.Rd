disproportionality_analysis(
  drug_selected,
  reac_selected,
  temp_drug = Drug,
  temp_reac = Reac,
  meddra_level = "pt",
  drug_level = "substance",
  restriction = "none",
  minimum_cases = 3,

}
\arguments{
\item{drug_selected}{A list of drugs for analysis. Can be a list of lists (to collapse terms together).}

\item{reac_selected}{A list of adverse events for analysis. Can be a list of lists (to collapse terms together).}

\item{temp_drug}{Drug dataset. Can be set to sample_Drug for testing}

\item{temp_reac}{Reac dataset. Can be set to sample_Reac for testing}

\item{meddra_level}{The desired MedDRA level for analysis (default is "pt").}

\item{drug_level}{The desired drug level for analysis (default is "substance"). If set to "custom" allows a list of lists for reac_selected (collapsing multiple terms).}

\item{restriction}{Primary IDs to consider for analysis (default is "none", which includes the entire population). If set to Demo[!RB_duplicates_only_susp]$primaryid, for example, allows to exclude duplicates according to one of the deduplication algorithms.}

\item{minimum_cases}{Threshold of minimum cases for calculating identifyin a signal (default is 3).}

\item{frequentist_threshold}{Threshold for defining the significance of the lower limit of the Reporting Odds Ratio (default is 1).}

\item{log2_threshold}{Threshold for defining the significance of the lower limit of the Information Component (default is 0).}

\item{multiple_comparison}{Logical specifying whether to perform Bonferroni correction for multiple testing on the ROR. Default to TRUE. Particularly important when running the disproportionality on many combinations.}

\item{store_pids}{Logical specifying whether to store primaryids recording the drug and primaryids recording the event as lists. Default to FALSE.}

\item{save_in_excel}{Whether to save the outcome in an excel. Defaults to TRUE}

\item{file_name}{The name of the Excel file to save the results. Default is "Descriptives.xlsx". It only works if save_in_excel is TRUE.}
