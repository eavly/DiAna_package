\usage{
network_analysis(
  pids,
  entity = "reaction",
  remove_singlet = TRUE,
  remove_negative_edges = TRUE,
  file_name = paste0(project_path, "network.tiff"),
  width = 1500,
  height = 1500,
  labs_size = 1,
  min_frequency_term = 0.01,
  restriction = "none",
  temp_reac = Reac,
  temp_indi = Indi,
  temp_drug = Drug,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{pids}{Numeric vector of unique identifiers on which the network analysis should be performed.}

\item{entity}{Character specifying the type of entity to analyze ("reaction", "indication", or "substance").}

\item{remove_singlet}{Logical indicating whether to remove singleton nodes (nodes with no edges). Default is TRUE.}

\item{remove_negative_edges}{Logical indicating whether to remove edges with negative weights. Default is TRUE.}

\item{file_name}{Character string specifying the file name (including path) to save the network visualization. Default is "network.tiff".}

\item{width}{Numeric specifying the width of the saved image in pixels. Default is 1500.}

\item{height}{Numeric specifying the height of the saved image in pixels. Default is 1500.}

\item{labs_size}{Size of labels in network visualization. Default is 1. It can be changed if visualization is not good.}

\item{min_frequency_term}{Frequency threshold for a term in the dataset to be included in the analysis. Default to 0.01}

\item{restriction}{Restriction performed in the analysis. Default is none. It could be set to 'suspects' if entity is 'substance' to restrict the analysis to primary and secondary suspects}

\item{temp_reac}{Reac dataset. Can be set to sample_Reac for testing}

\item{temp_indi}{Indi dataset. Can be set to sample_Indi for testing}

\item{temp_drug}{Drug dataset. Can be set to sample_Drug for testing}

\item{save_plot}{Whether the plot should be saved as a tiff. Defaults to true}
}
\value{
NULL (invisibly). Saves a network visualization as a TIFF file.
}
\description{
This function performs network analysis on the provided data and generates a visualization of the network. It uses IsingFit to model the network structure, clusters nodes using Louvain method, and visualizes the resulting network graph.
}
\examples{
# Perform network analysis for reactions with specified pids
net_plot <- network_analysis(
  pids = sample_Demo$primaryid,
  entity = "reaction", temp_reac = sample_Reac,
  save_plot = FALSE
)
plot(net_plot)
